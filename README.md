# StardustPilot: Streamlining Data Ingestion for High-Velocity Systems

StardustPilot is a robust and efficient Go-based application designed to manage and orchestrate data ingestion pipelines from various sources into a centralized repository. It provides a configurable and extensible framework for handling diverse data formats and protocols, ensuring data integrity and optimal throughput for high-velocity data streams. This tool aims to simplify the complex process of data acquisition, transformation, and loading, enabling organizations to rapidly leverage real-time insights from their data.

StardustPilot addresses the common challenges associated with data ingestion, such as handling disparate data sources, managing data transformations, and ensuring data quality. By providing a modular and configurable architecture, StardustPilot allows developers to easily adapt the system to specific data ingestion requirements. The application leverages Go's concurrency features to handle high data volumes efficiently, minimizing latency and maximizing throughput. It abstracts away the complexities of underlying data sources and storage systems, allowing users to focus on extracting value from their data. Ultimately, StardustPilot aims to be a reliable and scalable solution for building and managing data ingestion pipelines in modern data-driven organizations.

The application offers features like dynamic routing based on message content, data validation against pre-defined schemas, and built-in support for common data formats (JSON, CSV, Avro). StardustPilot utilizes a plugin architecture, enabling developers to create custom data source connectors and transformation modules to cater to specific data ingestion needs. It also integrates with monitoring and logging systems to provide real-time insights into pipeline performance and identify potential issues. This makes it easier to maintain and troubleshoot the system. The tool is designed with fault tolerance in mind, implementing mechanisms to handle transient errors and ensure data is not lost during ingestion. These features make StardustPilot a valuable asset for any organization looking to streamline its data ingestion processes and unlock the full potential of its data assets.

## Key Features

*   **Modular Architecture:** Designed with a plugin-based architecture, allowing for easy extensibility and customization of data source connectors and transformation modules. Specifically, the `plugin` package exposes an interface for creating custom input readers and output writers.
*   **Dynamic Routing:** Implements content-based routing, enabling messages to be dynamically routed to different destinations based on their content. This is achieved using a configurable routing table and a rule engine that evaluates message payloads.
*   **Data Validation:** Supports schema validation to ensure data quality and consistency. Utilizes the `jsonschema` library for JSON schema validation and provides an interface for integrating with other schema validation libraries.
*   **Concurrency Management:** Leverages Go's concurrency primitives (goroutines and channels) to handle high data volumes efficiently. A configurable number of worker goroutines are used to process incoming messages concurrently.
*   **Error Handling and Retry Mechanism:** Implements robust error handling and a retry mechanism to ensure data is not lost due to transient errors. This is accomplished by maintaining a queue of failed messages and periodically retrying them.
*   **Monitoring and Logging:** Integrates with popular monitoring and logging systems, such as Prometheus and ELK stack, to provide real-time insights into pipeline performance and identify potential issues. Specifically, the application exposes metrics via HTTP endpoints and logs events using the `logrus` library.
*   **Data Transformation:** Provides built-in support for common data transformations, such as filtering, mapping, and aggregation. Custom transformation functions can also be easily added through the plugin architecture.

## Technology Stack

*   **Go:** The core programming language used for building StardustPilot. Go's concurrency model and performance make it well-suited for handling high-velocity data streams.
*   **gRPC:** Used for inter-process communication between different components of the system. gRPC provides a high-performance and efficient way to exchange data.
*   **Protocol Buffers:** Used for defining data structures and message formats. Protocol Buffers are a language-neutral, platform-neutral, extensible mechanism for serializing structured data.
*   **JSON Schema:** Used for validating the structure and content of JSON data. The `jsonschema` library is used for implementing JSON schema validation.
*   **Logrus:** A structured logger for Go, providing a flexible and configurable logging system.
*   **Prometheus:** A monitoring and alerting toolkit used for collecting and analyzing metrics.
*   **Docker:** Used for containerizing the application, making it easy to deploy and manage.

## Installation

1.  Ensure you have Go installed (version 1.18 or later).
2.  Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/Nikeran22/StardustPilot.git`
3.  Navigate to the project directory: `cd StardustPilot`
4.  Download dependencies: `go mod download`
5.  Build the application: `go build -o stardustpilot`

## Configuration

StardustPilot can be configured using environment variables. Below are some of the key environment variables:

*   `PORT`: The port on which the application will listen (default: 8080).
*   `LOG_LEVEL`: The logging level (e.g., `debug`, `info`, `warn`, `error`).
*   `INPUT_TYPE`: The type of input source (e.g., `kafka`, `http`).
*   `OUTPUT_TYPE`: The type of output destination (e.g., `database`, `file`).
*   `KAFKA_BROKER`: The Kafka broker address (required if `INPUT_TYPE` is `kafka`).
*   `DATABASE_URL`: The database connection URL (required if `OUTPUT_TYPE` is `database`).

The application also supports configuration via a YAML file. The file path can be specified using the `CONFIG_FILE` environment variable.

## Usage

Example usage of the command-line application:

./stardustpilot --config config.yaml

The application will start and begin ingesting data based on the configuration.

Detailed API documentation (if applicable) would include the available endpoints, request/response formats, and authentication methods. Given the current description, this would likely involve detailing the gRPC services exposed for internal component communication and any HTTP endpoints used for monitoring or configuration updates.
